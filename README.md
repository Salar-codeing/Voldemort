and when you run the decryption file it will ask for a code and when you put the code in it
will decrypt all of the files that have been encrypted 

## Requirements
python 3 or higher

## How to use Voldemort
to run voldemort just run the command: "python3 voldemort.py"

to decrypt the files run the command: "python3 decerypt.py"

## The code
the code by defualt is 69420 but you can change it in the "decrypt.py" file by chaning the "code" variable
